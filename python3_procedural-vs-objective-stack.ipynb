    "# stack / LIFO\n",
    "A stack in data structure terms is like a stack of coins; if you want to add a coin you have to put it on the top of the stack and if you want to remove a coin you need to remove it from the top. LIFO is an acronym standing for Last In First Out, which is a handy description for a stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stack is an object with two elementary operations, conventionally named _push_ (when a new element is placed on top) and _pop_ (when an element is removed from the top).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `queue` structure is a stack/LIFO inverse where the first element added is the first element removed (i.e. FIFO - first in first out)."
